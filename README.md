This is a collection of machine learning programs I used while writing a research paper testing the hypothesis that machine learning can effectively detect computer hacks in the future. I trained the programs on the CICIDS2017 dataset. For each type of architecture, I made a very simple ML program and that trained on all of the data and then also made a balance version of each architecture that included balancing changes like SMOTE, overfitting, etc to try and get better performance out of them. I should not that I'm very new to ML and neural networks so there may be errors in my code.
